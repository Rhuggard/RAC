This is an access control demo project for the University I am attending.

A demo of how a system allowing requests to drive access control rather than relying predominantly a top down administrative model could work.

This uses paperclip to manage files and present thumbnails of images. This is not secure, sessions are checked for but access control policies are only checked on the view level at the moment.

BG is from subtlepatterns.com
Also similar scaffolding to Agile Web Development With Rails (Which was handy for figureing out bugs, and a very good book btw)

Licence pending (OSS ofcourse, but I have to check which is best for this).
